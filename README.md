Abstract
Summary:- A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) called the "e-rupee" is to be included into the nation's current financial system as part of this project. The central bank issues and controls this digital currency, which provides a safe and effective way to make digital payments with the intention of improving financial inclusion, payment effectiveness, and general economic stability.
Problem Statement:- CBDC AND E-RUPEE BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN INNOVATION AND ADOPTION.
Methodology:- The project adheres to a systematic methodology that comprises extensive testing, technology selection, security assessment, stakeholder involvement, legal and regulatory analysis, and feasibility assessment. The procedure calls for careful planning, strict development, ongoing oversight, and adherence to all applicable laws.
Key Findings:- 
1.	A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of a country's national currency, issued and regulated by the central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, CBDCs are centralized and are considered legal tender. They exist alongside physical banknotes and coins, providing a digital representation of a country's official currency.
a.	Financial Inclusion: By giving those who are underbanked or unbanked access to banking services, CBDCs help increase financial inclusion. It is not necessary to have a regular bank account in order to use a digital wallet. 
b.	Cross-Border Payments: By accelerating and streamlining cross-border payments, CBDCs can eliminate the need for middlemen and foreign exchange costs. Remittances and foreign trade may become more effective as a result.
c.	Monetary Policy and Control: CBDCs can help central banks more efficiently adopt and adjust monetary policy. More specifically, they can affect inflation, money supply, and interest rates.
d.	Financial Stability: By lowering the possibility of bank runs and offering a more secure option to privately produced digital currencies, CBDCs can improve financial stability. It can also aid in reducing problems like fake money.
e.	Reduced Transaction Costs: The use of digital currencies can result in financial savings from the need to produce, distribute, and manage real cash along with the current payment infrastructure.
f.	Smart Contracts and Programmable Money: Certain CBDCs have the ability to include smart contract features, which enables programmable money and automated, self-executing financial agreements.
g.	Combatting Illicit Activities: Improved traceability made possible by CBDCs can aid law enforcement in their fight against illegal activities such as tax evasion and money laundering.
h.	Innovation and Development: CBDCs have the potential to encourage innovation in the financial industry and result in the creation of new financial services and products.

6. Literature Review
RBI governor Shaktikanta Das recently clarified the differences between CBDC & UPI stating, “In CBDC, you will draw the digital currency and keep it in your wallet on your mobile. When you make a payment at a shop or to another individual, it will move from your wallet to their wallet”
India, Singapore and China have been the most prominent countries who have undertaken this form of online payment. Infact, China has been the foremost player in the CBDC form of payment, as is evident from the below stats, as of Jan 2023:-
 
We can see, the amount involved in China’s CBDC, almost equal to 14 billion e-CNY. And this no. has been increasing more ever since. 
7. Requirement Analysis:-

12. Deployment and Release: 
The software will be deployed by integrating the framework release by RBI. The Direct Model (Single Tier model) and the Indirect Model (Two-Tier model) are the two models used for the issuance and administration of CBDCs. A direct model would have the central bank in charge of handling the issuance, account maintenance, and transaction verification of the CBDC system.
A central bank and other intermediaries, such as banks and other service providers, each have their specific function under an indirect model. Under this arrangement, the central bank merely manages wholesale payments to intermediaries; it does not directly issue CBDC to consumers through intermediaries. Instead, the intermediary handles any consumer claims.
The indirect model is comparable to the existing physical currency management system, in which banks oversee various functions such as note distribution to the general public, account maintenance, compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering/countering terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regulations, transaction verification, etc. 
The user/clients will have to register themselves through their email id’s, phone no. and then setup the password for security. The further verification will be done by OTP facility.
To send CBDC from their wallet, users will have to enter the special hash address for the destination wallet, and enter the amount.
To receive CBDC in their wallet, user can request for a send-up payment by sending request for the required amount to the parent wallet, using special hash address.
